Victoria & Albert Museum ical feed
=======

I find the 'events pages' ( http://www.vam.ac.uk/whatson/ ) of the Victoria & Albert Museum website a bit overwhelming,
and it doesn't support an ical feed. 

This project fills that need. 

Notes
====

- The feed doesn't show every event. For instance: there are many (& I can highly recommend them!) daily tours, 
but these are at consistent & regular times so they've been omitted.
- The feed only shows the next month's events.
- The data may be out of date/events may cancel at the last minute: so please check with the V&A directly 
if there's any events you particular want to see.
- The times use BST (British Summer Time)

While I believe this to feed to be accurate, please check with the V&A or the V&A's events pages
( http://www.vam.ac.uk/whatson/ ) for accurate information.
